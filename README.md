# SpaceInTetris
A terminal Tetris game made with pure swift for macOS.

This game was the first Swift project of three new Swift programmers, in Apple Developer Academy | Mackenzie.
The ultimate goal of this Tetris clone was to learn the basics of Swift (Darwin library, XCode, etc) and macOS terminal usage.
