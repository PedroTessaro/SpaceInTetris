# SpaceInTetris
A terminal Tetris game made with pure swift for macOS.

This game was the first Swift project of three new Swift programmers, in Apple Developer Academy | Mackenzie.
The ultimate goal of this Tetris clone was to learn the basics of Swift (Darwin library, XCode, etc) and macOS terminal usage.

    <ul>
        <li> Three screen were developed in the process, the first one was the game screen, where all the magic happens.</li> 
        <li> The second one was the menu, where we have an animation that makes random color blocks fall and stack until the screen is filled.</li>
        <li> The last one was a game over screen, that allows the player to retry the game, return to menu or end the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> For the game to work, you need to change the default XCode terminal to macOS terminal.</li>
        <li> You need to define the terminal size to 52 x 25.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Collaborators</h2>
